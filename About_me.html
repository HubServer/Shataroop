    <p class="text"><b>Hi, I am Shataroop Sarkar, a high school student at Vision International School. I have been living in Kolkata since I was born.

    My father works at SIMPLEX, and my mother is a housewife. I have an older sister studying at Jadavpur University.
        
    In the past few months, I have enrolled myself in Software/Web Development. I believe that I gained real-world skills by watching online Software/Web Development Course by "Apna College". I also got some motivation from my two most favourite cousin, one of them works at SBI and the other at IBM.
        
    Other than my studies, I love to play football, and I am an active member of Olympic Club at Konnagar, where I practice football.</b></p>
